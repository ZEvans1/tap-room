As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a large growler. While most growlers are 32 ounces, some are 64. I'll need to select the appropriate growler size and correctly decrease the remaining number of pints left.

As a patron, I want to filter the available kegs by style or flavor of beer and/or kombucha.

As an employee, I want to select an option to put a certain keg on sale. This would lower the cost by a percentage of my choosing, and perhaps change a keg's appearance in the list to draw customers' attention to it.

As an employee, I might want to program a "happy hour" option I can select to put all kegs on sale.
