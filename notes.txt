As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.

As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
